You wake up, feeling groggy. You wonder where you are. It feels more like a dungeon or something. There's a rough bed in the corner of the room. Well, not quite, it's a sheet atop bale of hay. As you look around, you notice a barred door. You sit up and put your legs out the bed.

Memories rush to your mind.

Debt-ridden, becoming a gladiator was your only way out.
Or was it?
Perhaps, it was your own hot-blooded youth, urging you to jump into the arena.

Regardless, what's done is done. Now, it's time to fight.
