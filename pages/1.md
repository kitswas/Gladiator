# Waking up

You wake up; feeling groggy. You wonder where you are. Grey walls, a barred door and no windows - a distinct dungeon-like appearance. There’s a rough bed in the corner of the room. Well, not quite a bed; it’s a sheet atop a bale of hay. You sit up and move out of the bed.

Memories rush to your mind.

Debt-ridden, becoming a gladiator was your only way out.  
Or was it?  
Perhaps, it was your youthful hot-bloodedness urging you to jump into the arena.

Regardless, what's done is done.

_If_ you survive long enough, you'll end up as a magistrii or maybe even a [summa rudis](https://imperiumromanum.pl/en/curiosities/summa-rudis-referee-of-gladiatorial-fights/).

Now, it's time to fight.
