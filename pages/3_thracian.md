# Thracian

They call you _warlike_, _ferocious_, _bloodthirsty_, and _barbarous_.

Blue eyes, red hair, tattoos running all over your ripped muscules - you are a dream lover to many.  
With only a loincloth around your waist, your handsome appearance is exposed for all to see.

You don your armour. Helmet, check. Greaves, check.

Offering a prayer to [Ares, your patron God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares), you pick up your sica(sword) and parmula(shield).
