# Thracian

They call you _warlike_, _ferocious_, _bloodthirsty_, and _barbarous_.

You pick up your sica and shield and offer a prayer to [Ares, your patron God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares).  
Armour? Pah, warriors don't wear armour.

With only a loincloth around your waist, your handsome appearance is exposed for all to see.  
Blue eyes, red hair, tattoos running all over your ripped muscules - you are a dream lover to many.
