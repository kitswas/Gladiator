# The Arena

The stands are packed with spectators, all yelling and screaming. The crowd is cheering, cheering for the blood of the brave.

You see people clad in light armour, some have shields and some have round bucklers.
The summa rudis is on a dais on one side, applauding wildly.
There are no prisoners here. The lack of the condemned raises your hopes for a worthy fight.
