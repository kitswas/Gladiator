# The Arena

The stands are packed with spectators, all yelling and screaming. The crowd is cheering, cheering for the blood of the brave.

You see people clad in light armour, some have large shields, and some have round bucklers.  
The Editor is on a dais on one side, applauding wildly.  
There are no prisoners here. The lack of the condemned raises your hopes for a worthy fight.

The crowd is getting even louder. You see a man next to you wearing a horned helmet. You tap him on the shoulder and point him to the dais. Then, you both go down the stairs.

When you reach the bottom, you notice a massive, hulking figure leaning over the railing. It is wearing the armour of a Legionnaire and wielding a massive sword.

The Editor has just finished his speech. He looks at you and says, "You have chosen the path of the Gladiator. See the crowd? They will decide your fate."

Your horned companion chuckles and says, "I hope you know what you're doing, my friend. This game is _sine missione_."  
"I'll survive," you say.  
"We will meet again if you do."
